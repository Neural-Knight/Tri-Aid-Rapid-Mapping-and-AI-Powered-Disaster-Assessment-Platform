# DisasterLens AI: AI-Powered Disaster Assessment Platform

DisasterLens AI (also known as Tri-Aid) is a comprehensive disaster response platform that bridges the critical information gap during the first 48 hours after a disaster occurs. The platform combines pre-disaster mapping, real-time post-disaster data collection, and advanced AI analysis to generate rapid, actionable disaster assessment reports.

## What DisasterLens AI Solves

When disasters strike, emergency responders and aid organizations often struggle with:
- Incomplete, delayed, or hard-to-access information
- Disconnected data sources and formats
- Lack of coordinated situation awareness
- Inability to quickly determine where resources are most needed

DisasterLens AI addresses these challenges by creating a unified platform where community members and professional responders can collaborate to build a comprehensive disaster assessment within 48 hours.

## How It Works

### 1. Pre-Disaster Baseline (Alpha Team)

The platform establishes baseline data about communities before disasters strike:

- **Automated Location Mapping**: Uses OpenStreetMap to gather data about critical infrastructure (hospitals, schools, shelters, etc.)
- **Population Data Integration**: Incorporates demographic information for affected areas
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies vulnerable locations and populations based on historical and geographical data

### 2. Post-Disaster Data Collection (Bravo Team)

When a disaster occurs, the platform rapidly collects information through multiple channels:

- **Social Media Monitoring**: Aggregates and filters social media posts related to the disaster
- **News Source Integration**: Extracts relevant information from news articles and reports
- **Field Report Submission**: Mobile-optimized forms for on-site responders to submit observations
- **Damage Assessment**: Structured data collection for categorizing damage levels to infrastructure

### 3. AI-Powered Analysis

The platform leverages advanced AI to process and analyze collected data:

- **Data Verification**: Cross-references information from multiple sources to ensure accuracy
- **Information Categorization**: Automatically tags and organizes incoming data
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Uses Google's Gemini AI to generate comprehensive situational reports
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Tracks changes in conditions over time to identify trends

### 4. Actionable Outputs

DisasterLens AI delivers several key outputs:

- **Interactive Disaster Maps**: Visual representation of affected areas with damage assessment overlays
- **Resource Allocation Recommendations**: AI-generated suggestions for prioritizing aid distribution
- **Comprehensive Situation Reports**: Clear, concise summaries of current conditions, needs, and response activities
- **API Integration**: Allows other disaster response tools to utilize the gathered data

## Technical Architecture

DisasterLens AI consists of two main components:

### Frontend (React Application)
- Interactive maps using MapLibre GL
- Intuitive data entry forms
- Real-time social media monitoring
- Report generation and viewing interfaces
- Responsive design for field use on mobile devices

### Backend (FastAPI Application)
- RESTful API endpoints for data collection and retrieval
- OpenStreetMap integration for location data
- Social media and news article scraping
- Background task processing for resource-intensive operations
- Google Gemini AI integration for report generation

## Real-World Impact

DisasterLens AI makes disaster response:

- **Faster**: Critical information available in hours instead of days or weeks
- **Smarter**: AI-powered analysis ensures resources go where they're most needed
- **More Inclusive**: Enables community participation in disaster assessment
- **More Coordinated**: Creates a single source of truth for all responders
- **More Adaptable**: Works across different disaster types and geographical regions
