## Disaster Event: Kerala Floods

## Executive Summary

The state of Kerala, India, experienced devastating floods between August 8 and August 25, 2018, considered the worst the region had seen since 1924 [2]. The floods were triggered by unusually heavy monsoon rains, with the state receiving 771 mm of rainfall in the first 20 days of August, 179% above normal levels [1]. This extreme rainfall forced the opening of the sluice gates of 78 out of 80 dams, including those at Mullaperiyar and Idukki in the Western Ghats [1]. The sudden release of water intensified the flooding, impacting a wide range of areas from highlands and cities to lower plains [1]. Experts also cited mismanagement of dams as a contributing factor to the severity of the floods [5].

The floods resulted in widespread devastation, causing significant loss of life, displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, and extensive damage to property and infrastructure. The impact extended beyond immediate physical damage, with concerns rising about disease outbreaks and long-term recovery challenges. While rescue operations successfully saved thousands, the focus shifted towards relief, rehabilitation, and preventing disease outbreaks as the rains subsided [2]. The situation required a multi-faceted response involving government agencies, rescue teams, local fishermen, and international aid.

## Impact Assessment

- **Affected areas:** Ernakulam, Idukki, Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, and Thrissur districts were severely flooded [1]. The floods affected areas ranging from highlands and cities to lower plains [1].
- **Casualties and injuries:** Over 400 fatalities were reported [1]. At least 230 deaths were reported with over 360 fatalities since June [2]. The death toll was expected to rise as waters receded [2]. The total death toll reached at least 370 [3].
- **Property damage:** Over 40,000 hectares of farmland were submerged [1]. 26,000 houses were severely damaged [1]. Infrastructure damage was estimated at almost $3 billion [3]. The Kochi airport runways were flooded, leading to its closure [2].
- **Displacement statistics:** Over 720,000 people were displaced [1], approximately 725,000 people were displaced and sheltering in 5,645 relief camps [2]. Over 800,000 people were displaced and moved to shelters [3], while the total number of affected individuals was estimated to be well over 1.5 million [3].

## Response Efforts

- **Government actions:** Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan convened an all-party meeting to address the situation [4]. The National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) prioritized the needs for food, water, medicines, and the restoration of essential services [2].
- **Relief operations:** Relief efforts included the provision of food, water, medicines, and the restoration of essential services like power, fuel, telecom, and transport [2]. The UAE offered Rs 700 crore for relief and rebuilding [4]. The health ministry established 3,700 medical camps and deployed specialized medical teams [4]. Trains delivered RO purifiers and drinking water [4]. Donations poured in [2].
- **Rescue efforts:** Rescue operations reportedly saved around 22,000 people [2]. Thousands of personnel from the army, air force, navy, and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) were involved in rescue operations [3]. Airdropping supplies and rescuing those marooned in isolated areas were the primary focuses [3]. Fishermen from across Kerala played a crucial role, utilizing approximately 500 boats to assist in rescue efforts [3].

## Current Status

- **Latest situation:** The rains had subsided, and no red alert was in effect for Kerala's districts [2].
- **Recovery progress:** The focus shifted to cleanup, relief, rehabilitation, and preventing disease outbreaks [2]. The INS Garuda naval base in Kochi was open for commercial flights [2, 4]. Efforts were focused on restoring normalcy, including restoring phone connectivity, ATM services, water, and electricity supplies [4].
- **Ongoing challenges:** The spread of diseases due to the non-availability of clean drinking water was a major concern [4]. People were still trapped in inaccessible areas [4]. An urgent need for skilled workers to aid in the recovery was highlighted [4]. The lack of scientific decision support systems for reservoir operations and flood management across India was recognized [5].
