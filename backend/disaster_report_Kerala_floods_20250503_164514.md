## Disaster Event: Kerala Floods (August 8 - August 17, 2018)

## Executive Summary

Between August 8th and August 17th, 2018, Kerala, India, experienced catastrophic flooding due to unusually heavy monsoon rains [SOURCE 2, SOURCE 3]. This event, considered the worst flooding in the state since 1924 [SOURCE 1], was exacerbated by the release of water from numerous dams, including those at Mullaperiyar and Idukki [SOURCE 2]. All 14 districts of Kerala were placed under red alert [SOURCE 1]. The floods resulted in widespread devastation, claiming hundreds of lives, displacing hundreds of thousands of people, causing significant infrastructure damage, and disrupting daily life across the state [SOURCE 1, SOURCE 2, SOURCE 3]. A critical contributing factor was the lack of scientific decision support systems for managing water reservoirs and releasing water from dams [SOURCE 4].

The impact spanned the entire state, affecting highlands, cities, and lower plains [SOURCE 2]. Response efforts involved the government, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the armed forces, and local communities, including fishermen who played a vital role in rescue operations [SOURCE 3]. Despite these efforts, the scale of the disaster overwhelmed resources, and the immediate aftermath involved extensive rescue operations, provision of shelter and supplies, and attempts to restore essential services [SOURCE 1, SOURCE 3]. The long-term recovery required significant financial investment and a re-evaluation of dam management practices to prevent similar disasters in the future [SOURCE 4].

## Impact Assessment

- **Affected areas:** All 14 districts of Kerala [SOURCE 1], impacting highlands, cities, and lower plains [SOURCE 2]. Severely affected districts included Ernakulam, Idukki, Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, and Thrissur [SOURCE 2].
- **Casualties and injuries:** Over 400 deaths were reported [SOURCE 2]. The death toll reached 73 as of August 16th [SOURCE 1], climbing to 370 by the end of August [SOURCE 3].
- **Property damage:** More than 40,000 hectares of farmland were submerged [SOURCE 2], and 26,000 houses were severely damaged [SOURCE 2]. Infrastructure losses were estimated at almost $3 billion [SOURCE 3]. Transportation, power, communication, and drinking water distribution were severely disrupted [SOURCE 1].
- **Displacement statistics:** Over 720,000 people were displaced [SOURCE 2], with over 800,000 displaced to shelters [SOURCE 3]. Including those displaced to relatives/friends' homes, the total displaced population was estimated to be over 1.5 million [SOURCE 3].

## Response Efforts

- **Government actions:** All 14 districts were under red alert [SOURCE 1]. 35 dams were opened [SOURCE 1].
- **Relief operations:** Over 150,000 people were rescued and housed in 1,068 relief camps [SOURCE 1]. Airdropping of supplies was underway [SOURCE 3].
- **Rescue efforts:** Rescue operations involved thousands of army, air force, and navy troops, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and approximately 500 local fishing boats [SOURCE 3]. Fishermen were actively involved in rescuing people from interior lakes and rivers [SOURCE 3]. 22,000 people were evacuated as of Sunday when the rains subsided [SOURCE 3].

## Current Status

- **Latest situation:** Many people were still living in partially flooded homes at the time of some reports [SOURCE 3]. Kochi airport operations were suspended until August 18 [SOURCE 1], and later reopened.
- **Recovery progress:** The lack of flood warning systems and scientific decision support systems for dam operations was highlighted, pointing to the need for future improvements to disaster preparedness [SOURCE 4].
- **Ongoing challenges:** The public transport system collapsed in many parts of central Kerala [SOURCE 1]. The overall disaster continued to affect millions of people, with ongoing relief efforts for those stranded and displaced [SOURCE 3]. The state faced significant financial and logistical challenges in rebuilding infrastructure and providing long-term support to affected populations.
