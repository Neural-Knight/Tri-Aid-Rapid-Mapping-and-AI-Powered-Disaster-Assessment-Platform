## Disaster Event: Alappuzha Floods

## Executive Summary

The state of Kerala, India, experienced catastrophic flooding in August 2018, triggered by unusually heavy rainfall (42% above normal) and the subsequent overflowing of rivers and dams [SOURCE 1]. The floods, which lasted over a month, impacted all 14 districts of Kerala, with Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Thrissur, and Wayanad among the worst affected [SOURCE 1]. This event marked the worst flooding the region had seen in a century [SOURCE 4]. The crisis was intensified by the opening of dam gates, including all five sluice gates of the Idukki dam [SOURCE 2].

The floods resulted in widespread devastation, including loss of life, massive displacement, and extensive property damage. Over 1 million people were displaced [SOURCE 1], and at least 483 lives were lost [SOURCE 1]. The response involved a large-scale multi-agency effort, with the Indian Army, Navy, Air Force, NDRF and other Central Armed Police Forces participating in rescue and relief operations [SOURCE 1, SOURCE 4]. While the immediate crisis subsided with receding floodwaters, the focus shifted to providing essential supplies and restoring essential services [SOURCE 4].

## Response Efforts

- **Government actions:** The Kerala government launched a large-scale relief effort, providing food, shelter, and medical assistance [SOURCE 1]. Relief camps and distribution centers were established to aid those affected [SOURCE 1, SOURCE 2, SOURCE 4]. 80 dams were opened across the state in response to the deluge [SOURCE 4].
- **Relief operations:** Civil society organizations, NGOs, and private companies contributed donations and support [SOURCE 1]. Medical relief camps were established to combat the threat of increased disease [SOURCE 4].

These efforts were supported by numerous helicopters, aircraft, and motorboats, resulting in 82,442 rescues by August 17 [SOURCE 4].

## Current Status

- **Latest situation:** By August 19, the heavy rains had begun to ease, and floodwaters were slowly receding in some areas [SOURCE 4].
- **Recovery progress:** The focus shifted to providing emergency supplies of food, water, and medicines, and restoring essential services like power, fuel, telecom, and transport [SOURCE 4].
- **Ongoing challenges:** The floods highlighted the need for improved water management, disaster preparedness, and community engagement in India [SOURCE 1]. The event also demonstrated the resilience and generosity of the Indian people [SOURCE 1]. The increased threat of diseases as the flood water receded was also a challenge [SOURCE 4]. The long-term economic impact and the need for significant reconstruction efforts posed continuing challenges.
