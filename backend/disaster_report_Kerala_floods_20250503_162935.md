## Disaster Event: Kerala Floods (August 8-25, 2018)

## Executive Summary

The Kerala floods of August 2018 represent the most severe flooding event in the state since 1924. Torrential monsoon rains, exacerbated by the release of water from numerous dams, led to widespread devastation across all 14 districts of Kerala [SOURCE 1]. The floods, which began around August 8th and peaked between August 16th and 25th, caused widespread landslides, disruption of essential services like transportation, power, communication, and drinking water, and immense damage to property and infrastructure [SOURCE 1, SOURCE 3]. The state experienced rainfall 179% higher than normal during the first 20 days of August [SOURCE 2]. The disaster resulted in hundreds of deaths and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people [SOURCE 2, SOURCE 3].

The response to the crisis involved significant efforts from the government, military forces, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and local communities, particularly fishermen [SOURCE 3]. However, the scale of the disaster overwhelmed the available resources, and ongoing relief and recovery efforts are essential to address the long-term needs of the affected population [SOURCE 3]. A crucial element in understanding the disaster is the role of dam management. Experts and officials acknowledge that shortcomings in scientific decision support systems for managing water reservoirs and releasing water from dams contributed to the severity of the floods [SOURCE 4].

## Impact Assessment

- **Affected areas:** All 14 districts of Kerala were under red alert, indicating severe flooding [SOURCE 1]. The floods particularly impacted Ernakulam, Idukki, Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, and Thrissur districts downstream from major dams [SOURCE 2]. The entire state, including highlands, cities, and lower plains, experienced significant flooding [SOURCE 2].

- **Casualties and injuries:** The death toll reached 73 as of August 16th [SOURCE 1], and rose to over 370 since late May [SOURCE 3]. Over 400 deaths were recorded overall [SOURCE 2].

- **Property damage:** Over 26,000 houses were severely damaged [SOURCE 2]. Over 40,000 hectares of farmland were submerged [SOURCE 2]. Infrastructure losses were estimated at almost $3 billion [SOURCE 3].

- **Displacement statistics:** Over 720,000 people were displaced and sheltered in relief camps [SOURCE 2].  Including those displaced to relatives' homes, the total displaced population was estimated to be over 1.5 million [SOURCE 3].

## Response Efforts

- **Government actions:** The government opened 35 dams across the state, leading to river levels exceeding alert thresholds [SOURCE 1]. Over 1,068 relief camps were established throughout the state [SOURCE 1].

- **Relief operations:** Rescue operations focused on evacuating stranded individuals and airdropping supplies [SOURCE 3]. Over 150,000 people were rescued [SOURCE 1].

- **Rescue efforts:** Thousands of army, air force, and navy troops were involved in rescue operations [SOURCE 3]. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) also participated [SOURCE 3]. Approximately 500 local fishing boats assisted in rescuing people from interior lakes and rivers [SOURCE 3]. As of August 19, 22,000 people had been evacuated [SOURCE 3].

## Current Status

- **Latest situation:** Many people were still living in partially flooded homes [SOURCE 3].

- **Recovery progress:** (Limited information - further research needed) The sources available do not provide detailed information on recovery progress. One source highlights the lack of scientific decision support systems for water reservoirs which should be addressed in order to prevent future flooding [SOURCE 4].

- **Ongoing challenges:**  Millions of people were still affected, with ongoing relief efforts to help those stranded and displaced [SOURCE 3]. The need for improved flood warning systems and decision support systems for dam operations was highlighted [SOURCE 4]. The lack of a flood warning system in Kerala was a critical issue [SOURCE 4].
