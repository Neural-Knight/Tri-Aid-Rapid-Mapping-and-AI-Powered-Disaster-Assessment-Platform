      "description": "The Kerala floods of 2018 were a series of devastating floods that hit the southern Indian state of Kerala in August 2018, affecting all 14 districts, including Alappuzha, and resulting in the displacement of over 1 million people and the loss of over 483 lives [3].",
      "summary": "In August 2018, the state of Kerala in southern India experienced devastating floods due to unusually heavy rainfall (42% above normal) and overflowing rivers and dams. All 14 districts were affected, with Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Thrissur, and Wayanad among the worst hit. The floods lasted over a month, causing widespread destruction and displacement.\n\nThe impact was immense, with over 1 million people displaced and at least 483 lives lost. Thousands of houses and buildings were damaged or destroyed, and the economic losses were estimated to be over $3 billion. The heavy rainfall was exacerbated by factors such as overfilled dams, deforestation in the Western Ghats, and encroachment on floodplains. While a direct link is hard to establish, climate change is believed to have contributed to the extreme weather.\n\nThe response to the disaster was massive, involving the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force in rescue and relief operations. The Kerala government launched a large-scale relief effort, providing food, shelter, and medical assistance. Civil society organizations, NGOs, and private companies contributed donations and support. Relief camps and distribution centers were established to aid those affected.\n\nThe floods highlighted the need for improved water management, disaster preparedness, and community engagement in India. The event also demonstrated the resilience and generosity of the Indian people.\n"

      "description": "The situation in Kerala worsened on August 10, 2018, with the opening of dam gates and heavy rainfall, leading to a red alert in eight districts, including Alappuzha [4].",
      "summary": "On August 9, 2018, Kerala, India experienced a severe flooding event that worsened significantly by August 10, 2018. The situation escalated due to the opening of all five sluice gates of the Idukki dam, along with the lifting of shutters on over two dozen other dams. This resulted in the submergence of vast areas of the state, which was already experiencing unprecedented rainfall levels not seen in decades.\n\nThe impact was devastating, with the death toll reaching 29 in the 48 hours leading up to August 10, and further reports indicating the loss of lives in the prior 24 hours. Eight districts \u2013 Wayanad, Idukki, Alapuzzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Palakkad, Malappuram, and Kozhikode \u2013 were placed on red alert, signifying the severity of the situation.\n\nIn response to the disaster, 439 relief camps were established across the state. These camps provided shelter to over 50,000 displaced individuals, highlighting the scale of the displacement caused by the floods. The opening of the dam gates worsened the floods, impacting a huge part of the state.\n\nThe content's current status reflects the acute phase of the disaster, emphasizing the ongoing downpour and the immediate aftermath of the dam releases. The focus is on rescue and relief efforts, as well as managing the displacement of a significant portion of the population.\n"
